# androidLteSignals

## Purpose
A simple app to investigate the difference in LTE Signal strength measurements from different (apparently still under development) parts of the android API. Specifically the PhoneStateListener appears to be giving one set of values, while getting the info from CellInfo results in different values. 

I noticed this when I compared the values from my first attempt to extract this data with the values from a popular signal status app (apparently using the PhoneStateListener method).

## Software
- Lots of extra Android development autogenerated stuff, the [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/adam0antium/androidLteSignals/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/valleydrop/signal1/MainActivity.java) file is the only one I really have any content in.
